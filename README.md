# Server side rendered component

## What we will cover?

* How can we scalable a web application without a JavaScript framework?
* What are the benefits to not using a framework?
* What are the downsides to not using a framework?

## Notes:

I think that most of the benefits from a JavaScript framework comes from the structures it brings, allowing developers to produce consistent results.

The benefit of not using framework is your application will be lighter and stand the test of time.

The downside is the risk of code rot is greater, and the complexity of logic in certain problems goes up dramatically, for example the routing.

Creating a scalable frontend projects, you need to face some challenges:

* Modularity
* State
* Simplicity
